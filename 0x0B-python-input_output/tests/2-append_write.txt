===============================
This is the 2-append_write module
===============================

This is a simple module and it only has
one function called append_write(filename="", text="")

# The module should be documented
::
	>>> mod_docs = __import__('2-append_write').__doc__
	>>> len(mod_docs) > 5
	True

Using append_write
=================

This function reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

::
	>>> write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file
	>>> write_file("file_append.txt", "")
	0
	>>> append_write = __import__('2-append_write').append_write
	>>> append_write("file_append.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
	24

# The function should be documented
::
	>>> fun_docs = append_write.__doc__
	>>> len(fun_docs) > 5
	True

# The function should append to the file
::
	>>> read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file
	>>> read_file("file_append.txt")
	This School is so cool!

	>>> append_write("file_append.txt", "ALX School\n")
	11
	>>> read_file("file_append.txt")
	This School is so cool!
	ALX School
